# Org-mode syntax highlighting for Vim

Org.vim is a minimal [Org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) plugin for
[Vim](https://www.vim.org/). It provides only the absolute necessities (e.g.
syntax highlighting and folding) at a high standard.

The main goal of this plugin is to replicate [Vim's default
Markdown](https://github.com/tpope/vim-markdown/) editing experience for
Org-mode files.
