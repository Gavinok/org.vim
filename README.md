# Org mode and Outline mode syntax highlighting for Vim

Org.vim is a very minimal [Org mode][] and [Outline mode][] plugin for
[Vim](https://www.vim.org) providing only syntax highlighting and folding.

This plugin aims to replicate Vim's [existing Markdown](https://github.com/tpope/vim-markdown/)
editing experience on Org mode (and Outline mode) files, rather than trying to
be a full featured Org mode plugin -- that is what Emacs is for.

Originally created so I would be able to quickly edit and easily read Org mode
files in Vim without any of _the bells and whistles_ of the original Emacs
implementation.  It also allowed me use [Orgzly](https://github.com/orgzly/orgzly-android/)
(highly recommended) without worrying about Emacs lock-in.

**Notice**: this project is considered complete by the author. You can still
report bugs and request additional features, however it is unlikely that new
features will be added.
