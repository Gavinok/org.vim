# Org-mode syntax highlighting for Vim

This is a minimal [Org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) plugin for Vim. It provides
only the absolute necessities (e.g. syntax highlighting, indentation, folding,
etc.). The goal of this plugin is to replicate Vim's existing
[Markdown](https://github.com/tpope/vim-markdown/) editing experience for
Org-mode files.

**NOTE**: This plugin is still a work in progress.

- **TODO**: test with other colorthemes
- **TODO**: fix italics
- **TODO**: fix spell checker
